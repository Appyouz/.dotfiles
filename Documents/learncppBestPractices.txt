# Best practices for C++

-> Prefer pass by reference to pass by address unless
  you have a specific reason to use pass by address.

-> Avoid returning references to non-const local static variables.
-> Name your program-defined types starting with a capital letter and do not use a suffix.
-> Avoid assigning explicit values to your enumerators unless you have a compelling reason to do so.
-> Favor scoped enumerations over unscoped enumerations unless thereâ€™s a compelling reason to do otherwise.
-> Prefer the (non-copy) braced list form when initializing aggregates.
