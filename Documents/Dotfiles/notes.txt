# Pacman mirror issue fix:
1  Generate mirrorlist at https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist with mirror status enabled, to only include up to date mirrors
2. Copy & Paste the mirrorlist into /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.generated
3. Run sudo sed -i "s/^#Server/Server/" /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.generated to enable all the newly generated mirrors
4. Run sudo sh -c "rankmirrors -n 6 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.generated > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist" to choose the 6 speediest mirrors for mirrorlist
5. Run pacman -Syyuu to refresh the pacman database and ensure installed packages correspond to the versions offered by the new mirrorlist
